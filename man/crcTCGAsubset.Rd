\title{colorectal TCGA gene expression data with subtype annotation}
\format{An object of class \code{ExpressionSet} with 16949 rows and 92 columns.}
\usage{
crcTCGAsubset
}
\description{
The Cancer Genome Atlas level 3 RSEM genes data was retrieved
from Broad GDAC Firehose, doi:10.7908/C11G0KM9
(\url{http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/}). Samples were annotated with
Consensus Molecular Subtypes (Guinney 2015), Sadanandam subtypes
(Isella 2015) and ABSOLUTE estimated tumor purity (Aran 2015). Features were
annotated using \code{\link[CMScaller]{fromTo}}. Rownames are Ensembl ids.
Included are 92 HiSeq test set samples with genes with maximum count
exceeding 25.
